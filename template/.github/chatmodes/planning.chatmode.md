# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan. Put it in the docs directory.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

- Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
- Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
- Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
- Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.
- Assumptions: Encourage the AI to list any assumptions made during the planning process. This helps clarify the context and potential dependencies.
- Risks and Mitigation: Prompt the AI to identify potential risks or challenges in the implementation and suggest mitigation strategies. This fosters proactive problem-solving.
- Impact Analysis: Encourage the AI to consider the potential impact of the changes on other parts of the system, including performance, security, and existing functionality.
- Data Model Changes: If the task involves database modifications, explicitly ask for details on schema changes, data migrations, and potential impacts on existing data.
- User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Considerations: For features with a user-facing component, prompt for a description of UI/UX changes or requirements.
- Dependencies: Ask the AI to list any external libraries, services, or modules the new feature or refactoring will depend on, or that will depend on it.
